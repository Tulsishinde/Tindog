                    <h5>Things You Need to Know About Dog Harnesses</h5>
                    <p>When it comes to walking your dog, a harness can be an excellent alternative to a traditional collar and leash setup. Dog harnesses offer numerous benefits, providing comfort, control, and safety for both you and your furry friend. In this article, we will explore the key things you need to know about dog harnesses to make an informed decision for your canine companion. A dog harness is designed to be worn around a dog’s body, distributing the force of pulling across the chest and shoulders rather than just the neck (as with collars). This helps reduce the risk of injury to the dog’s neck and throat, making it a safer option for controlling your pet during walks.</p>
